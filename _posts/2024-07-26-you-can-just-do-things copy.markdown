The world enforces implicit (and explicit) rules that we unconsciously (and consciously) follow. Don't fall into the trap (DFITT).

Some things you can just do:
- Stand on a table
- Miss a lecture
- Break something - anything (e.g. a cup)
- Say no
- Say yes
- Sleep in the day, wake up at night
- Learn about computers (or anything) on your own

Some notes:
1. If something feels hard to do, **break it down**. I can't stress this enough. If you know how to break problems down into smaller more manageable units, you will go further than you believe.
2. You can do many things. The world pushes you into being a specialist. It's shaped so that we arrive at an even distribution of specialists - DFITT.
3. Stop relying on other people. In general, don't wait for people to help you. Most people don't care about you. They shouldn't. They have their own problems to solve.
4. Stop waiting for perfect conditions to do something. Work with what you have. You might actually come up with new or more creative ways of doing something. 
5. When learning something new try your best to shorten the loop between mistake and feedback. You will learn faster. 
6. You can learn anything. If you are reading this, you have internet. If you really wanted to, you could probably build a rocket.
